        <p>The Fonte Gaia is a monumental fountain located in the Piazza del Campo in the center of Siena, Italy. The first fountain in the Piazza del Campo was completed in 1342 after hydraulic construction had led water to the site. Underground pipes brought water to the site from 25 kilometers away. Legend holds that the fountain was met with much joy, thus it was given the name Gaia or joyous.</p>

          "We stumbled on this restaurant in the early morning on our way to the Duomo and promised ourselves we would come back for dinner. I'm so glad we did! We arrived a short bit before the sun went down, were given a table with a glorious view, and enjoyed a lovely rapport with our waiter who provided excellent service and advice throughout the evening. Our food was delicious and the presentation was inspired. Before we departed we saw other members from our architectural tour also dining at this establishment. From each of their tables, we received a report similar to our own: this was an entirely wonderful dining experience!"</p>
